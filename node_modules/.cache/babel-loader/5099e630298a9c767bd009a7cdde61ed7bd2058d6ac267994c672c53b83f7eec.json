In particular, due to the visual and dynamic nature of the webpages that you’ll be making, it’s important to make sure that your website will also make sense to visually-impaired or blind users. Many visually-impaired or blind users access web pages with the help of screen readers. Screen readers parse through the HTML of your web page and read the contents out loud, responding to commands to navigate around the page, and take actions such as clicking on a link, typing in an input field, or submitting a form. In this resource, we’ll give an overview of a few ways that you can improve the accessibility of your web page and help screen readers better interpret it!\\n\\nOne way to make the elements of your page more comprehensible to screen readers is to provide alt text for images. Alt, or alternative, text is provided as an attribute to the ${\"`<img>`\"} tag to describe the image to the screen reader. Be sure to provide succinct alt text descriptions for each image on your web page! \\n\\nARIA, also known as WAI-ARIA, stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. ARIA defines a variety of markup extensions, usually HTML5 attributes, that can be added to elements to give screen readers more information about the element and help visually-impaired users better grasp what’s happening on the webpage. For instance, one useful ARIA attribute is the ${\"`role`\"} attribute. When added to an element, this will provide the screen reader with extra context about what that element’s function is in context of a page. There are many other functions for ARIA attributes, such as telling the user the state of forms and checkboxes, and even calling their attention to an element on the page that was just changed by JavaScript. We won’t cover everything related to ARIA in this article, but feel free to check out the spec [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA).`,\n    author: \"Ben\",\n    slug: \"accessibility-and-html\"\n  },\n  \"authentication-and-oauth\": {\n    title: \"Authentication and OAuth\",\n    body: `While it is common to think of authentication as the interaction between a human user and an application, sometimes the user is another application. Many apps expose interfaces to their information in the form of an API (application program interface). For example, the Spotify API provides endpoints for almost all of its functionality. This allows applications to fetch data from the Spotify music catalog and manage user’s playlists and saved music. Since these external requests could overwhelm a service and also access user information, they need to be secured using authentication.\\n\\nThe most basic pattern for API access from another application is using an API key. Public APIs usually provide a developer portal where you can register your application and generate a corresponding API key. This key is then unique to your application. When your application makes a request, this key is sent along with it. The API can then verify that your application is allowed access and provide the correct response based on the permission level of your application. The API can track what type and frequency of requests each application is making. This data can be used to throttle requests from a specific application to a pre-defined level of service. This prevents applications from spamming an endpoint or abusing user data, since the API can easily block that application’s API key and prevent further malicious use of the API by that application.`,\n    author: \"Lily\",\n    slug: \"authentication-and-oauth\"\n  },\n  \"black-box-programming\": {\n    title: \"Black Box Programming\",\n    body: `As you begin to work with classes and objects, you may come across the term black box programming.
